A Data Access Object (DAO) focuses on basic database operations like insert, update, and delete, essentially acting as a direct interface to the database, while a Repository is more domain-centric, providing methods that reflect business logic and operations on domain objects, rather than directly interacting with the database schema; essentially, a repository can utilize a DAO to perform data access operations but presents a higher-level domain-specific interface to the application logic. 
Example:
DAO:
A method to retrieve a user by their database ID: `User getUserById(int userId)`. 
This method would likely directly execute a SQL query to fetch the user data based on the ID. 
Repository:
A method to find an active user by their username: `User findActiveUserByUsername(String username)`. 
This method would likely use the DAO to retrieve the user data from the database, but would then apply additional business logic to check if the user is active before returning the result. 
Key differences:
Focus:
DAO is data-centric, dealing with database operations directly, while Repository is domain-centric, focusing on business concepts and domain objects.
Abstraction Level:
A DAO provides a lower-level abstraction of database access, while a Repository offers a higher-level abstraction aligned with the application domain.
Method Semantics:
DAO methods often directly map to database operations like "insert" and "delete", whereas Repository methods are named based on domain concepts like "`activateUser`" or "`findActiveCustomers`". 
Implementation:
A Repository can often be implemented using a DAO underneath, meaning the Repository can leverage the DAO's database access functionality while providing a cleaner, domain-specific interface to the application layer.
